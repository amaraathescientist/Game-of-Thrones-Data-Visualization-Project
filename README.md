# Tableau Data Visualization
## Introduction
Game of Thrones is a drama series with over eight seasons where nine noble families wage war against each other in order to gain control over the mythical land of Westeros. 
Ever wondered how many deaths there were or who had the most kills and much more?\
Ryan Murphy manually collected all the data that can be found in the excel file below. \
I created a Visualization with Tableau to demonstarte this data

## Dataset Used 
Excel File: [got_death_data](https://github.com/amaraathescientist/Game-of-Thrones-Data-Visualization-Project/blob/main/game-of-thones-deaths.xlsx)
